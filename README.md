# RAG Document Assistant using Endee Vector Database Architecture

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-style document assistant where **vector search is the core component**.

The system:

- Extracts text from PDF documents
- Splits text into fixed-size chunks
- Generates embeddings using SentenceTransformers (MiniLM)
- Stores embeddings via a vector database abstraction layer
- Performs cosine similarity search
- Exposes REST APIs using FastAPI

This project is architected to integrate with **Endee**, a high-performance C++ vector database.

## 🚀 Key Features

- PDF ingestion pipeline
- Smart fixed-size chunking
- Embedding generation
- Cosine similarity scoring
- Vector search as primary retrieval mechanism
- FastAPI REST backend
- Swagger documentation
- Clean modular architecture

## RAG Workflow

This system implements a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline:

1. Document upload
2. Text chunking
3. Embedding generation
4. Vector similarity retrieval
5. Context-based answer generation


## 🧠 Why Endee?

Endee is a high-performance C++ vector database designed for scalable embedding storage and retrieval.

Forked Endee repository:
https://github.com/nitishanaga/endee

### Intended Production Integration

In a production deployment:

1. Endee would be started using its provided `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Embeddings generated by this application would be sent to the Endee service.
3. Queries would be executed against Endee’s indexed vector store.
4. Top-k similar results would be returned to the backend.

### Current Implementation

For demonstration purposes, this project implements an abstraction layer called:

```
EndeeClient
```

This simulates interaction with the Endee service while preserving architectural alignment.

The abstraction layer ensures:

- Clean separation of concerns
- Replaceable storage backend
- Production-ready design
- Clear vector database interaction boundary

This design allows seamless transition to real Endee service integration.

### Deployment Note

Endee is designed to run as a standalone C++ vector database service using Docker.

For portability and ease of evaluation, this project demonstrates Endee integration through a clearly defined abstraction layer (`EndeeClient`) rather than requiring a full Docker-based deployment.

This ensures:

- The project runs immediately without infrastructure setup
- The vector database interaction boundary is clearly defined
- The system remains fully aligned with Endee’s architecture

In a production scenario, the `EndeeClient` would directly communicate with a running Endee service via its API.

Use Swagger UI to:

1. Call `/index`
2. Call `/search`

## 🧮 How Vector Search Works

1. PDF text is chunked into fixed-size segments.
2. Each chunk is converted into a numerical embedding vector.
3. Vectors are stored in the EndeeClient abstraction.
4. User query is converted into an embedding.
5. Cosine similarity is computed between query and stored vectors.
6. Top-k most similar chunks are returned.

Vector similarity is the core retrieval mechanism.
